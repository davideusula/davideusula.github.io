# Research Agenda

My research agenda investigates income distribution, power relations between workers and firms, and their interaction with market structure, technological regimes, and macroeconomic regimes.
The starting point is the functional distribution of income between labor and capital, with a particular focus on the labor share and its persistent decline over the last four decades in advanced economies. My work studies how the evolution of income distribution both responds to and feeds back into macroeconomic conditions, sectoral dynamics, and the organization of production.
The core of my research is the distributive conflict between wages and profits – the opposing claims of workers and firms over the income generated in production. This conflict is shaped by institutions and by the underlying economic structure: the macro environment, sectoral technological regimes (especially in U.S. manufacturing), and the way firms organize work and hierarchies.

At the macroeconomic level, my research examines how tensions between firms’ price-setting behavior and workers’ wage-setting capacity can trigger inflationary spirals driven by distributive claims. In this view, inflation is not merely a monetary phenomenon, but an emergent property of an economy where workers and firms contest the income share, giving rise to different macroeconomic regimes (for example, more wage-led or more profit-led).
